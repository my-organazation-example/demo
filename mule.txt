Mule Standalone vs. Application Server
Listed below are some of the advantages of running Mule standalone vs running it as a web application deployed in an application server (Tomcat, WebSphere, JBoss, etc.)
Wrapper control: Mule Standalone makes use of a Java Service Wrapper which controls the JVM from your operating system and starts Mule. The wrapper can handle system signals and provides better interaction between the JVM and the underlying operating system.
Smaller memory footprint: Mule standalone loads only the required resources for an application; an application server adds its own resources.
Anypoint DataMapper support: DataMapper is supported only on a Mule Enterprise Standalone runtime; other application servers do not support DataMapper.
Deployment and Application Management: Through the Mule Management Console, you have full control of the applications running on Mule Standalone, allowing you to deploy/undeploy applications and restart/stop the server. Other application servers do not support this visibility.
